## Customers API

This is a sample application designed to showcase the capabilities of the new `Developist.Core.Persistence` package.
Demonstrating a clean architecture approach within a minimal API design, this somewhat contrived application integrates various libraries (CQRS, Entity Framework Core, etc.) and patterns (Mediator, Unit of Work, Repository, etc.) to provide a comprehensive example of how to use the new persistence library in a modern .NET web API.
